# xtermtris
Text-based Tetris, built from scratch using xterm.js

Inspired by [the programming scene in the 2023 Tetris movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNVqjBaX-c4), a story of how something that seems as boring as programming can manage to bring disparate worlds together (i shed a tear every time i watch it)
